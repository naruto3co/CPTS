# Introduction to Linux Privilege Escalation

(Extracted from uploaded PDF) fileciteturn0file0

## Overview
The root account on Linux systems provides full administrative access. During assessments, gaining a low-privileged shell often requires privilege escalation to root to fully compromise the host.

## Enumeration
Enumeration is the key step. Tools like **LinEnum** help, but manual enumeration is essential.

### OS & Kernel Version
- Identify distribution (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, etc.)
- Check kernel version for public exploits.

### Running Services
Identify services running as root. Many services—Nagios, Exim, Samba, ProFTPd—have known local privilege escalation flaws.

### Installed Packages
Outdated packages like **Screen 4.05.00** may allow privilege escalation.

### Logged-in Users
Checking active sessions may reveal lateral movement paths.

### Home Directory Inspection
Look for:
- `.bash_history`
- Config files
- SSH keys  
Example SSH directory:
```
~/.ssh
id_rsa
id_rsa.pub
```

### Bash History
Users may leak credentials using command-line arguments.

### Sudo Privileges
Check if user can run commands as root:
```
sudo -l
```
Look for **NOPASSWD** entries.

### Configuration Files
Search for `.conf`, `.config` files for credentials.

### /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow
Sometimes password hashes appear directly in `/etc/passwd`.

### Cron Jobs
Cron jobs may contain misconfigurations or writable scripts.

### Unmounted Drives
Mounting additional drives may reveal sensitive data.

### Writable Directories & Files
Writable paths may allow code execution:
```
find / -type d -perm -o+w
find / -type f -perm -o+w
```

This file summarizes enumeration steps for Linux privilege escalation. Use findings to exploit privileges in later stages.
