hashcat -a 0 -m 0 <hashes> [wordlist, rule, mask, ...]
  -a is used to specify the attack mode
  -m is used to specify the hash type
  <hashes> is a either a hash string, or a file containing one or more password hashes of the same type
  [wordlist, rule, mask, ...] is a placeholder for additional arguments that depend on the attack mode

Hash types
  Hashcat supports hundreds of different hash types, each of which is assigned a ID. A list of associated IDs can be generated by running hashcat --help.
  using hashcat --help to show types 


hashID can be used to quickly identify the hashcat hash type by specifying the -m argument.

Attack modes
Hashcat has many different attack mode, including dictionary, mask, combinator, and association.

Dictionary attack
  option  : -a 0
  example : hashcat -a 0 -m 0 e3e3ec5831ad5e7288241960e5d4fdb8 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

  The rule files that come with hashcat are typically found under /usr/share/hashcat/rules:
    ls -l /usr/share/hashcat/rules

  As another example, imagine an additional md5 hash was leaked from the SQL database: 1b0556a75770563578569ae21392630c. We weren't able to crack it using rockyou.txt alone, so in a subsequent attempt, we might apply some common rule-based transformations. One ruleset we could try is best64.rule, which contains 64 standard password modifications—such as appending numbers or substituting characters with their "leet" equivalents. To perform this kind of attack, we would append the -r <ruleset> option to the command, as shown below:
    hashcat -a 0 -m 0 1b0556a75770563578569ae21392630c /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule

Mask attack
  Option : -a 3
  For example, if we know that a password is eight characters long, rather than attempting every possible combination, we might define a mask that tests combinations of six letters followed by two numbers.
