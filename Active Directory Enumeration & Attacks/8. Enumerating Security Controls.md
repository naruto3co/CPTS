# Bối cảnh 
Windows Defender rất mạnh và có thể phát hiện các cuộc tấn công rà quét bên trong 
Mục đích : kiếm tra các công cụ rào cản ANTT có bật không, những thiếu sót hay gặp trong ANTT 

## Windows Defender
Windows Defender (or Microsoft Defender after the Windows 10 May 2020 Update) has greatly improved over the years and, by default, will block tools such as PowerView. There are ways to bypass these protections. These ways will be covered in other modules. We can use the built-in PowerShell cmdlet Get-MpComputerStatus to get the current Defender status. Here, we can see that the RealTimeProtectionEnabled parameter is set to True, which means Defender is enabled on the system.

## AppLocker

An application whitelist is a list of approved software applications or executables that are allowed to be present and run on a system. The goal is to protect the environment from harmful malware and unapproved software that does not align with the specific business needs of an organization. AppLocker is Microsoft's application whitelisting solution and gives system administrators control over which applications and files users can run. It provides granular control over executables, scripts, Windows installer files, DLLs, packaged apps, and packed app installers. It is common for organizations to block cmd.exe and PowerShell.exe and write access to certain directories, but this can all be bypassed. Organizations also often focus on blocking the PowerShell.exe executable, but forget about the other PowerShell executable locations such as %SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe or PowerShell_ISE.exe. We can see that this is the case in the AppLocker rules shown below. All Domain Users are disallowed from running the 64-bit PowerShell executable located at:

%SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe

So, we can merely call it from other locations. Sometimes, we run into more stringent AppLocker policies that require more creativity to bypass. These ways will be covered in other modules.

## Using Get-AppLockerPolicy cmdlet
```

## PowerShell Constrained Language Mode


PowerShell Constrained Language Mode locks down many of the features needed to use PowerShell effectively, such as blocking COM objects, only allowing approved .NET types, XAML-based workflows, PowerShell classes, and more. We can quickly enumerate whether we are in Full Language Mode or Constrained Language Mode.

### Enumerating Language Mode
```
PS C:\htb> $ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode

ConstrainedLanguage
```

## LAPS

The Microsoft Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) is used to randomize and rotate local administrator passwords on Windows hosts and prevent lateral movement. We can enumerate what domain users can read the LAPS password set for machines with LAPS installed and what machines do not have LAPS installed. The LAPSToolkit greatly facilitates this with several functions. One is parsing ExtendedRights for all computers with LAPS enabled. This will show groups specifically delegated to read LAPS passwords, which are often users in protected groups. An account that has joined a computer to a domain receives All Extended Rights over that host, and this right gives the account the ability to read passwords. Enumeration may show a user account that can read the LAPS password on a host. This can help us target specific AD users who can read LAPS passwords.

### Using Find-LAPSDelegatedGroups
```
PS C:\htb> Find-LAPSDelegatedGroups

OrgUnit                                             Delegated Groups
-------                                             ----------------

OU=Mail Servers,OU=Servers,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=L... INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins
OU=Mail Servers,OU=Servers,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=L... INLANEFREIGHT\LAPS Admins
```

The Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights checks the rights on each computer with LAPS enabled for any groups with read access and users with "All Extended Rights." Users with "All Extended Rights" can read LAPS passwords and may be less protected than users in delegated groups, so this is worth checking for.

### Using Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights
```
PS C:\htb> Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights

ComputerName                Identity                    Reason
------------                --------                    ------

WS01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL    INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins Delegated
WS01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL    INLANEFREIGHT\LAPS Admins   Delegated
```

We can use the Get-LAPSComputers function to search for computers that have LAPS enabled when passwords expire, and even the randomized passwords in cleartext if our user has access.

### Using Get-LAPSComputers
```
PS C:\htb> Get-LAPSComputers

ComputerName                Password       Expiration

# Credentialed Enumeration - from Linux

Now that we have acquired a foothold in the domain, it is time to dig deeper using our low privilege domain user credentials. Since we have a general idea about the domain's userbase and machines, it's time to enumerate the domain in depth. We are interested in information about domain user and computer attributes, group membership, Group Policy Objects, permissions, ACLs, trusts, and more. We have various options available, but the most important thing to remember is that most of these tools will not work without valid domain user credentials at any permission level. So at a minimum, we will have to have acquired a user's cleartext password, NTLM password hash, or SYSTEM access on a domain-joined host.

To follow along, spawn the target at the bottom of this section and SSH to the Linux attack host as the htb-student user. For enumeration of the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain using the tools installed on the ATTACK01 Parrot Linux host, we will use the following credentials: User=forend and password=Klmcargo2. Once our access is established, it's time to get to work. We'll start with CrackMapExec.

## CrackMapExec

CrackMapExec (CME, now NetExec) is a powerful toolset to help with assessing AD environments. It utilizes packages from the Impacket and PowerSploit toolkits to perform its functions. For detailed explanations on using the tool and accompanying modules, see the wiki. Don't be afraid to use the -h flag to review the available options and syntax.

## CME - Domain User Enumeration
We start by pointing CME at the Domain Controller and using the credentials for the forend user to retrieve a list of all domain users. Notice when it provides us the user information, it includes data points such as the badPwdCount attribute. This is helpful when performing actions like targeted password spraying. We could build a target user list filtering out any users with their badPwdCount attribute above 0 to be extra careful not to lock any accounts out.

The above snippet lists the groups within the domain and the number of users in each. The output also shows the built-in groups on the Domain Controller, such as Backup Operators. We can begin to note down groups of interest. Take note of key groups like Administrators, Domain Admins, Executives, any groups that may contain privileged IT admins, etc. These groups will likely contain users with elevated privileges worth targeting during our assessment.

## CME - Logged On Users
We can also use CME to target other hosts. Let's check out what appears to be a file server to see what users are logged in currently.
```
naruto3co@htb[/htb]$ sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.130 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 --loggedon-users

<SNIP>
```
We see that many users are logged into this server which is very interesting. We can also see that our user forend is a local admin because (Pwn3d!) appears after the tool successfully authenticates to the target host. A host like this may be used as a jump host or similar by administrative users. We can see that the user svc_qualys is logged in, who we earlier identified as a domain admin. It could be an easy win if we can steal this user's credentials from memory or impersonate them.

As we will see later, BloodHound (and other tools such as PowerView) can be used to hunt for user sessions. BloodHound is particularly powerful as we can use it to view Domain User sessions graphically and quickly in many ways. Regardless, tools such as CME are great for more targeted enumeration and user hunting.

## CME Share Searching
We can use the --shares flag to enumerate available shares on the remote host and the level of access our user account has to each share (READ or WRITE access). Let's run this against the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL Domain Controller.

### Share Enumeration - Domain Controller
```
naruto3co@htb[/htb]$ sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 --shares

SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:ACADEMY-EA-DC01) (domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)

SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  ZZZ_archive     READ
```

We see several shares available to us with READ access. The Department Shares, User Shares, and ZZZ_archive shares would be worth digging into further as they may contain sensitive data such as passwords or PII. Next, we can dig into the shares and spider each directory looking for files. The module spider_plus will dig through each readable share on the host and list all readable files. Let's give it a try.

### Spider_plus
```
naruto3co@htb[/htb]$ sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 -M spider_plus --share 'Department Shares'

SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:ACADEMY-EA-DC01) (domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [+] INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\forend:Klmcargo2 
SPIDER_P... 172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [*] Started spidering plus with option:
SPIDER_P... 172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [*]        DIR: ['print$']
SPIDER_P... 172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [*]        EXT: ['ico', 'lnk']
SPIDER_P... 172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [*]       SIZE: 51200
SPIDER_P... 172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [*]     OUTPUT: /tmp/cme_spider_plus
```
In the above command, we ran the spider against the Department Shares. When completed, CME writes the results to a JSON file located at /tmp/cme_spider_plus/<ip of host>. Below we can see a portion of the JSON output. We could dig around for interesting files such as web.config files or scripts that may contain passwords. If we wanted to dig further, we could pull those files to see what all resides within, perhaps finding some hardcoded credentials or other sensitive information.
```
naruto3co@htb[/htb]$ head -n 10 /tmp/cme_spider_plus/172.16.5.5.json 

{
    "Department Shares": {
        "Accounting/Private/AddSelect.bat": {
            "atime_epoch": "2022-03-31 14:44:42",
            "ctime_epoch": "2022-03-31 14:44:39",
            "mtime_epoch": "2022-03-31 15:14:46",
            "size": "278 Bytes"
        },
        "Accounting/Private/ApproveConnect.wmf": {
            "atime_epoch": "2022-03-31 14:45:14",

```

CME is powerful, and this is only a tiny look at its capabilities; it is worth experimenting with it more against the lab targets. We will utilize CME in various ways as we progress through the remainder of this module. Let's move on and take a look at SMBMap now.


## SMBMap
SMBMap is great for enumerating SMB shares from a Linux attack host. It can be used to gather a listing of shares, permissions, and share contents if accessible. Once access is obtained, it can be used to download and upload files and execute remote commands.

Like CME, we can use SMBMap and a set of domain user credentials to check for accessible shares on remote systems. As with other tools, we can type the command smbmap -h to view the tool usage menu. Aside from listing shares, we can use SMBMap to recursively list directories, list the contents of a directory, search file contents, and more. This can be especially useful when pillaging shares for useful information.

### SMBMap To Check Access
```
naruto3co@htb[/htb]$ smbmap -u forend -p Klmcargo2 -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -H 172.16.5.5

[+] IP: 172.16.5.5:445	Name: inlanefreight.local                               
        Disk                                                  	Permissions	Comment
	----                                                  	-----------	-------
	ADMIN$                                            	NO ACCESS	Remote Admin
	C$                                                	NO ACCESS	Default share
	Department Shares                                 	READ ONLY	
	IPC$                                              	READ ONLY	Remote IPC
	NETLOGON                                          	READ ONLY	Logon server share 
	SYSVOL                                            	READ ONLY	Logon server share 
	User Shares                                       	READ ONLY	
	ZZZ_archive                                       	READ ONLY
```

The above will tell us what our user can access and their permission levels. Like our results from CME, we see that the user forend has no access to the DC via the ADMIN$ or C$ shares (this is expected for a standard user account), but does have read access over IPC$, NETLOGON, and SYSVOL which is the default in any domain. The other non-standard shares, such as Department Shares and the user and archive shares, are most interesting. Let's do a recursive listing of the directories in the Department Shares share. We can see, as expected, subdirectories for each department in the company.

### Recursive List Of All Directories
