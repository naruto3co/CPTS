# Bối cảnh 
Windows Defender rất mạnh và có thể phát hiện các cuộc tấn công rà quét bên trong 
Mục đích : kiếm tra các công cụ rào cản ANTT có bật không, những thiếu sót hay gặp trong ANTT 

## Windows Defender
Windows Defender (or Microsoft Defender after the Windows 10 May 2020 Update) has greatly improved over the years and, by default, will block tools such as PowerView. There are ways to bypass these protections. These ways will be covered in other modules. We can use the built-in PowerShell cmdlet Get-MpComputerStatus to get the current Defender status. Here, we can see that the RealTimeProtectionEnabled parameter is set to True, which means Defender is enabled on the system.

## AppLocker

An application whitelist is a list of approved software applications or executables that are allowed to be present and run on a system. The goal is to protect the environment from harmful malware and unapproved software that does not align with the specific business needs of an organization. AppLocker is Microsoft's application whitelisting solution and gives system administrators control over which applications and files users can run. It provides granular control over executables, scripts, Windows installer files, DLLs, packaged apps, and packed app installers. It is common for organizations to block cmd.exe and PowerShell.exe and write access to certain directories, but this can all be bypassed. Organizations also often focus on blocking the PowerShell.exe executable, but forget about the other PowerShell executable locations such as %SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe or PowerShell_ISE.exe. We can see that this is the case in the AppLocker rules shown below. All Domain Users are disallowed from running the 64-bit PowerShell executable located at:

%SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe

So, we can merely call it from other locations. Sometimes, we run into more stringent AppLocker policies that require more creativity to bypass. These ways will be covered in other modules.

## Using Get-AppLockerPolicy cmdlet
```

## PowerShell Constrained Language Mode


PowerShell Constrained Language Mode locks down many of the features needed to use PowerShell effectively, such as blocking COM objects, only allowing approved .NET types, XAML-based workflows, PowerShell classes, and more. We can quickly enumerate whether we are in Full Language Mode or Constrained Language Mode.

### Enumerating Language Mode
```
PS C:\htb> $ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode

ConstrainedLanguage
```

## LAPS

The Microsoft Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) is used to randomize and rotate local administrator passwords on Windows hosts and prevent lateral movement. We can enumerate what domain users can read the LAPS password set for machines with LAPS installed and what machines do not have LAPS installed. The LAPSToolkit greatly facilitates this with several functions. One is parsing ExtendedRights for all computers with LAPS enabled. This will show groups specifically delegated to read LAPS passwords, which are often users in protected groups. An account that has joined a computer to a domain receives All Extended Rights over that host, and this right gives the account the ability to read passwords. Enumeration may show a user account that can read the LAPS password on a host. This can help us target specific AD users who can read LAPS passwords.

### Using Find-LAPSDelegatedGroups
```
PS C:\htb> Find-LAPSDelegatedGroups

OrgUnit                                             Delegated Groups
-------                                             ----------------

OU=Mail Servers,OU=Servers,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=L... INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins
OU=Mail Servers,OU=Servers,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=L... INLANEFREIGHT\LAPS Admins
```

The Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights checks the rights on each computer with LAPS enabled for any groups with read access and users with "All Extended Rights." Users with "All Extended Rights" can read LAPS passwords and may be less protected than users in delegated groups, so this is worth checking for.

### Using Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights
```
PS C:\htb> Find-AdmPwdExtendedRights

ComputerName                Identity                    Reason
------------                --------                    ------

WS01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL    INLANEFREIGHT\Domain Admins Delegated
WS01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL    INLANEFREIGHT\LAPS Admins   Delegated
```

We can use the Get-LAPSComputers function to search for computers that have LAPS enabled when passwords expire, and even the randomized passwords in cleartext if our user has access.

### Using Get-LAPSComputers
```
PS C:\htb> Get-LAPSComputers

ComputerName                Password       Expiration

# Credentialed Enumeration - from Linux

Now that we have acquired a foothold in the domain, it is time to dig deeper using our low privilege domain user credentials. Since we have a general idea about the domain's userbase and machines, it's time to enumerate the domain in depth. We are interested in information about domain user and computer attributes, group membership, Group Policy Objects, permissions, ACLs, trusts, and more. We have various options available, but the most important thing to remember is that most of these tools will not work without valid domain user credentials at any permission level. So at a minimum, we will have to have acquired a user's cleartext password, NTLM password hash, or SYSTEM access on a domain-joined host.

To follow along, spawn the target at the bottom of this section and SSH to the Linux attack host as the htb-student user. For enumeration of the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain using the tools installed on the ATTACK01 Parrot Linux host, we will use the following credentials: User=forend and password=Klmcargo2. Once our access is established, it's time to get to work. We'll start with CrackMapExec.

## CrackMapExec

CrackMapExec (CME, now NetExec) is a powerful toolset to help with assessing AD environments. It utilizes packages from the Impacket and PowerSploit toolkits to perform its functions. For detailed explanations on using the tool and accompanying modules, see the wiki. Don't be afraid to use the -h flag to review the available options and syntax.

## CME - Domain User Enumeration
We start by pointing CME at the Domain Controller and using the credentials for the forend user to retrieve a list of all domain users. Notice when it provides us the user information, it includes data points such as the badPwdCount attribute. This is helpful when performing actions like targeted password spraying. We could build a target user list filtering out any users with their badPwdCount attribute above 0 to be extra careful not to lock any accounts out.

The above snippet lists the groups within the domain and the number of users in each. The output also shows the built-in groups on the Domain Controller, such as Backup Operators. We can begin to note down groups of interest. Take note of key groups like Administrators, Domain Admins, Executives, any groups that may contain privileged IT admins, etc. These groups will likely contain users with elevated privileges worth targeting during our assessment.

## CME - Logged On Users
We can also use CME to target other hosts. Let's check out what appears to be a file server to see what users are logged in currently.
```
naruto3co@htb[/htb]$ sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.130 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 --loggedon-users

<SNIP>
```
We see that many users are logged into this server which is very interesting. We can also see that our user forend is a local admin because (Pwn3d!) appears after the tool successfully authenticates to the target host. A host like this may be used as a jump host or similar by administrative users. We can see that the user svc_qualys is logged in, who we earlier identified as a domain admin. It could be an easy win if we can steal this user's credentials from memory or impersonate them.

As we will see later, BloodHound (and other tools such as PowerView) can be used to hunt for user sessions. BloodHound is particularly powerful as we can use it to view Domain User sessions graphically and quickly in many ways. Regardless, tools such as CME are great for more targeted enumeration and user hunting.

## CME Share Searching
We can use the --shares flag to enumerate available shares on the remote host and the level of access our user account has to each share (READ or WRITE access). Let's run this against the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL Domain Controller.

### Share Enumeration - Domain Controller
```
naruto3co@htb[/htb]$ sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 --shares

SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:ACADEMY-EA-DC01) (domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)

SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  ZZZ_archive     READ
```

We see several shares available to us with READ access. The Department Shares, User Shares, and ZZZ_archive shares would be worth digging into further as they may contain sensitive data such as passwords or PII. Next, we can dig into the shares and spider each directory looking for files. The module spider_plus will dig through each readable share on the host and list all readable files. Let's give it a try.

### Spider_plus
```
naruto3co@htb[/htb]$ sudo crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 -M spider_plus --share 'Department Shares'

SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:ACADEMY-EA-DC01) (domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [+] INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\forend:Klmcargo2 
SPIDER_P... 172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [*] Started spidering plus with option:

SPIDER_P... 172.16.5.5      445    ACADEMY-EA-DC01  [*]     OUTPUT: /tmp/cme_spider_plus
```
In the above command, we ran the spider against the Department Shares. When completed, CME writes the results to a JSON file located at /tmp/cme_spider_plus/<ip of host>. Below we can see a portion of the JSON output. We could dig around for interesting files such as web.config files or scripts that may contain passwords. If we wanted to dig further, we could pull those files to see what all resides within, perhaps finding some hardcoded credentials or other sensitive information.
```
naruto3co@htb[/htb]$ head -n 10 /tmp/cme_spider_plus/172.16.5.5.json 

{
    "Department Shares": {
        "Accounting/Private/AddSelect.bat": {
            "atime_epoch": "2022-03-31 14:44:42",
            "ctime_epoch": "2022-03-31 14:44:39",
            "mtime_epoch": "2022-03-31 15:14:46",
            "size": "278 Bytes"
        },
        "Accounting/Private/ApproveConnect.wmf": {
            "atime_epoch": "2022-03-31 14:45:14",
     
<SNIP>
```

CME is powerful, and this is only a tiny look at its capabilities; it is worth experimenting with it more against the lab targets. We will utilize CME in various ways as we progress through the remainder of this module. Let's move on and take a look at SMBMap now.


## SMBMap
SMBMap is great for enumerating SMB shares from a Linux attack host. It can be used to gather a listing of shares, permissions, and share contents if accessible. Once access is obtained, it can be used to download and upload files and execute remote commands.

Like CME, we can use SMBMap and a set of domain user credentials to check for accessible shares on remote systems. As with other tools, we can type the command smbmap -h to view the tool usage menu. Aside from listing shares, we can use SMBMap to recursively list directories, list the contents of a directory, search file contents, and more. This can be especially useful when pillaging shares for useful information.

### SMBMap To Check Access
```
naruto3co@htb[/htb]$ smbmap -u forend -p Klmcargo2 -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -H 172.16.5.5

[+] IP: 172.16.5.5:445	Name: inlanefreight.local                               
        Disk                                                  	Permissions	Comment
	----                                                  	-----------	-------
	ADMIN$                                            	NO ACCESS	Remote Admin
	C$                                                	NO ACCESS	Default share
	Department Shares                                 	READ ONLY	
	IPC$                                              	READ ONLY	Remote IPC
	NETLOGON                                          	READ ONLY	Logon server share 
	SYSVOL                                            	READ ONLY	Logon server share 
	User Shares                                       	READ ONLY	
	ZZZ_archive                                       	READ ONLY
```

The above will tell us what our user can access and their permission levels. Like our results from CME, we see that the user forend has no access to the DC via the ADMIN$ or C$ shares (this is expected for a standard user account), but does have read access over IPC$, NETLOGON, and SYSVOL which is the default in any domain. The other non-standard shares, such as Department Shares and the user and archive shares, are most interesting. Let's do a recursive listing of the directories in the Department Shares share. We can see, as expected, subdirectories for each department in the company.

### Recursive List Of All Directories
```
naruto3co@htb[/htb]$ smbmap -u forend -p Klmcargo2 -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -H 172.16.5.5 -R 'Department Shares' --dir-only

[+] IP: 172.16.5.5:445	Name: inlanefreight.local

    <SNIP>
```
As the recursive listing dives deeper, it will show you the output of all subdirectories within the higher-level directories. The use of --dir-only provided only the output of all directories and did not list all files. Try this against other shares on the Domain Controller and see what you can find.

Now that we've covered shares, let's look at RPCClient.

### rpcclient
rpcclient is a handy tool created for use with the Samba protocol and to provide extra functionality via MS-RPC. It can enumerate, add, change, and even remove objects from AD. It is highly versatile; we just have to find the correct command to issue for what we want to accomplish. The man page for rpcclient is very helpful for this; just type man rpcclient into your attack host's shell and review the options available. Let's cover a few rpcclient functions that can be helpful during a penetration test.

Due to SMB NULL sessions (covered in-depth in the password spraying sections) on some of our hosts, we can perform authenticated or unauthenticated enumeration using rpcclient in the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain. An example of using rpcclient from an unauthenticated standpoint (if this configuration exists in our target domain) would be:
```
rpcclient -U "" -N 172.16.5.5
```

The above will provide us with a bound connection, and we should be greeted with a new prompt to start unleashing the power of rpcclient.
<img width="1158" height="310" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/186364eb-4a3e-4ade-a863-fedaa61cecde" />

From here, we can begin to enumerate any number of different things. Let's start with domain users.

### rpcclient Enumeration

While looking at users in rpcclient, you may notice a field called rid: beside each user. A Relative Identifier (RID) is a unique identifier (represented in hexadecimal format) utilized by Windows to track and identify objects. To explain how this fits in, let's look at the examples below:

The SID for the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain is: S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114.
When an object is created within a domain, the number above (SID) will be combined with a RID to make a unique value used to represent the object.
So the domain user htb-student with a RID:[0x457] Hex 0x457 would = decimal 1111, will have a full user SID of: S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-1111.
This is unique to the htb-student object in the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain and you will never see this paired value tied to another object in this domain or any other.

However, there are accounts that you will notice that have the same RID regardless of what host you are on. Accounts like the built-in Administrator for a domain will have a RID [administrator] rid:[0x1f4], which, when converted to a decimal value, equals 500. The built-in Administrator account will always have the RID value Hex 0x1f4, or 500. This will always be the case. Since this value is unique to an object, we can use it to enumerate further information about it from the domain. Let's give it a try again with rpcclient. We will dig a bit targeting the htb-student user.

### RPCClient User Enumeration By RID
```
rpcclient $> queryuser 0x457

        User Name   :   htb-student
        Full Name   :   Htb Student
        Home Drive  :
        Dir Drive   :
        Profile Path:
        Logon Script:

        Password can change Time :      Thu, 28 Oct 2021 12:26:52 EDT
        Password must change Time:      Wed, 13 Sep 30828 22:48:05 EDT
        unknown_2[0..31]...
        user_rid :      0x457
        group_rid:      0x201
        acb_info :      0x00000010
        fields_present: 0x00ffffff
        logon_divs:     168
        bad_password_count:     0x00000000
        logon_count:    0x0000001d
        padding1[0..7]...
        logon_hrs[0..21]...
```
When we searched for information using the queryuser command against the RID 0x457, RPC returned the user information for htb-student as expected. This wasn't hard since we already knew the RID for htb-student. If we wished to enumerate all users to gather the RIDs for more than just one, we would use the enumdomusers command.

### Enumdomusers
```
rpcclient $> enumdomusers

user:[administrator] rid:[0x1f4]
user:[guest] rid:[0x1f5]
user:[krbtgt] rid:[0x1f6]
user:[lab_adm] rid:[0x3e9]
user:[htb-student] rid:[0x457]
user:[avazquez] rid:[0x458]
user:[pfalcon] rid:[0x459]
user:[fanthony] rid:[0x45a]
user:[wdillard] rid:[0x45b]
user:[lbradford] rid:[0x45c]
user:[sgage] rid:[0x45d]
user:[asanchez] rid:[0x45e]
user:[dbranch] rid:[0x45f]
user:[ccruz] rid:[0x460]
user:[njohnson] rid:[0x461]
user:[mholliday] rid:[0x462]

<SNIP>
```
Using it in this manner will print out all domain users by name and RID. Our enumeration can go into great detail utilizing rpcclient. We could even start performing actions such as editing users and groups or adding our own into the domain, but this is out of scope for this module. For now, we just want to perform domain enumeration to validate our findings. Take some time to play with the other rpcclient functions and see the results they produce. For more information on topics such as SIDs, RIDs, and other core components of AD, it would be worthwhile to check out the Introduction to Active Directory module. Now, it's time to plunge into Impacket in all its glory.

### Impacket Toolkit
Impacket is a versatile toolkit that provides us with many different ways to enumerate, interact, and exploit Windows protocols and find the information we need using Python. The tool is actively maintained and has many contributors, especially when new attack techniques arise. We could perform many other actions with Impacket, but we will only highlight a few in this section; wmiexec.py and psexec.py. Earlier in the poisoning section, we grabbed a hash for the user wley with Responder and cracked it to obtain the password transporter@4. We will see in the next section that this user is a local admin on the ACADEMY-EA-FILE host. We will utilize the credentials for the next few actions.

https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/wmiexec.py
https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/psexec.py

### Psexec.py
One of the most useful tools in the Impacket suite is psexec.py. Psexec.py is a clone of the Sysinternals psexec executable, but works slightly differently from the original. The tool creates a remote service by uploading a randomly-named executable to the ADMIN$ share on the target host. It then registers the service via RPC and the Windows Service Control Manager. Once established, communication happens over a named pipe, providing an interactive remote shell as SYSTEM on the victim host.

### Using psexec.py
To connect to a host with psexec.py, we need credentials for a user with local administrator privileges.
```
psexec.py inlanefreight.local/wley:'transporter@4'@172.16.5.125
```
<img width="561" height="306" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0624c13e-6460-4da2-96fc-22ee376bfe44" />

Note that this shell environment is not fully interactive, so each command issued will execute a new cmd.exe from WMI and execute your command. The downside of this is that if a vigilant defender checks event logs and looks at event ID 4688: A new process has been created, they will see a new process created to spawn cmd.exe and issue a command. This isn't always malicious activity since many organizations utilize WMI to administer computers, but it can be a tip-off in an investigation. In the image above, it's also apparent that the process is running under the context of user wley on the host, not as SYSTEM. Impacket is an immensely valuable tool that has plenty of use cases. We will see many other tools in the Impacket toolkit throughout the remainder of this module. As a pentester working with Windows hosts, this tool should always be in our arsenal. Let's move on to the next tool, Windapsearch.

### Windapsearch
Windapsearch is another handy Python script we can use to enumerate users, groups, and computers from a Windows domain by utilizing LDAP queries. It is present in our attack host's /opt/windapsearch/ directory.

### Windapsearch - Domain Admins

```
naruto3co@htb[/htb]$ python3 windapsearch.py --dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -u forend@inlanefreight.local -p Klmcargo2 --da

[+] Using Domain Controller at: 172.16.5.5

```

From the results in the shell above, we can see that it enumerated 28 users from the Domain Admins group. Take note of a few users we have already seen before and may even have a hash or cleartext password like wley, svc_qualys, and lab_adm.

To identify more potential users, we can run the tool with the -PU flag and check for users with elevated privileges that may have gone unnoticed. This is a great check for reporting since it will most likely inform the customer of users with excess privileges from nested group membership.

### Windapsearch - Privileged Users

```
You'll notice that it performed mutations against common elevated group names in different languages. This output gives an example of the dangers of nested group membership, and this will become more evident when we work with BloodHound graphics to visualize this.

### Bloodhound.py
Once we have domain credentials, we can run the BloodHound.py BloodHound ingestor from our Linux attack host. BloodHound is one of, if not the most impactful tools ever released for auditing Active Directory security, and it is hugely beneficial for us as penetration testers. We can take large amounts of data that would be time-consuming to sift through and create graphical representations or "attack paths" of where access with a particular user may lead. We will often find nuanced flaws in an AD environment that would have been missed without the ability to run queries with the BloodHound GUI tool and visualize issues. The tool uses graph theory to visually represent relationships and uncover attack paths that would have been difficult, or even impossible to detect with other tools. The tool consists of two parts: the SharpHound collector written in C# for use on Windows systems, or for this section, the BloodHound.py collector (also referred to as an ingestor) and the BloodHound GUI tool which allows us to upload collected data in the form of JSON files. Once uploaded, we can run various pre-built queries or write custom queries using Cypher language. The tool collects data from AD such as users, groups, computers, group membership, GPOs, ACLs, domain trusts, local admin access, user sessions, computer and user properties, RDP access, WinRM access, etc.

It was initially only released with a PowerShell collector, so it had to be run from a Windows host. Eventually, a Python port (which requires Impacket, ldap3, and dnspython) was released by a community member. This helped immensely during penetration tests when we have valid domain credentials, but do not have rights to access a domain-joined Windows host or do not have a Windows attack host to run the SharpHound collector from. This also helps us not have to run the collector from a domain host, which could potentially be blocked or set off alerts (though even running it from our attack host will most likely set off alarms in well-protected environments).

Running bloodhound-python -h from our Linux attack host will show us the options available.

BloodHound.py Options
```
naruto3co@htb[/htb]$ bloodhound-python -h

usage: bloodhound-python [-h] [-c COLLECTIONMETHOD] [-u USERNAME]
                         [-p PASSWORD] [-k] [--hashes HASHES] [-ns NAMESERVER]
                         [--dns-tcp] [--dns-timeout DNS_TIMEOUT] [-d DOMAIN]
                         [-dc HOST] [-gc HOST] [-w WORKERS] [-v]
                         [--disable-pooling] [--disable-autogc] [--zip]

Python based ingestor for BloodHound
For help or reporting issues, visit https://github.com/Fox-IT/BloodHound.py

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c COLLECTIONMETHOD, --collectionmethod COLLECTIONMETHOD
                        Which information to collect. Supported: Group,
                        LocalAdmin, Session, Trusts, Default (all previous),
                        DCOnly (no computer connections), DCOM, RDP,PSRemote,
                        LoggedOn, ObjectProps, ACL, All (all except LoggedOn).
                        You can specify more than one by separating them with
                        a comma. (default: Default)
  -u USERNAME, --username USERNAME
                        Username. Format: username[@domain]; If the domain is
                        unspecified, the current domain is used.
  -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD
                        Password

  <SNIP>
```
As we can see the tool accepts various collection methods with the -c or --collectionmethod flag. We can retrieve specific data such as user sessions, users and groups, object properties, ACLS, or select all to gather as much data as possible. Let's run it this way.

### Executing BloodHound.py
```
naruto3co@htb[/htb]$ sudo bloodhound-python -u 'forend' -p 'Klmcargo2' -ns 172.16.5.5 -d inlanefreight.local -c all 

INFO: Found AD domain: inlanefreight.local
INFO: Connecting to LDAP server: ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
INFO: Found 1 domains
INFO: Found 2 domains in the forest
INFO: Found 564 computers
INFO: Connecting to LDAP server: ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
INFO: Found 2951 users
INFO: Connecting to GC LDAP server: ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
INFO: Found 183 groups
INFO: Found 2 trusts
INFO: Starting computer enumeration with 10 workers

<SNIP>
```
The command above executed Bloodhound.py with the user forend. We specified our nameserver as the Domain Controller with the -ns flag and the domain, INLANEFREIGHt.LOCAL with the -d flag. The -c all flag told the tool to run all checks. Once the script finishes, we will see the output files in the current working directory in the format of <date_object.json>.

### Viewing the Results
```
naruto3co@htb[/htb]$ ls

20220307163102_computers.json  20220307163102_domains.json  20220307163102_groups.json  20220307163102_users.json
```

### Upload the Zip File into the BloodHound GUI
We could then type sudo neo4j start to start the neo4j service, firing up the database we'll load the data into and also run Cypher queries against.

Next, we can type bloodhound from our Linux attack host when logged in using freerdp to start the BloodHound GUI application and upload the data. The credentials are pre-populated on the Linux attack host, but if for some reason a credential prompt is shown, use:
```
user == neo4j / pass == HTB_@cademy_stdnt!.
```

Once all of the above is done, we should have the BloodHound GUI tool loaded with a blank slate. Now we need to upload the data. We can either upload each JSON file one by one or zip them first with a command such as zip -r ilfreight_bh.zip *.json and upload the Zip file. We do this by clicking the Upload Data button on the right side of the window (green arrow). When the file browser window pops up to select a file, choose the zip file (or each JSON file) (red arrow) and hit Open.

### Uploading the Zip File
<img width="866" height="503" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b27931ec-521d-48d9-bfc1-a63d8091279c" />
Now that the data is loaded, we can use the Analysis tab to run queries against the database. These queries can be custom and specific to what you decide using custom Cypher queries. There are many great cheat sheets to help us here. We will discuss custom Cypher queries more in a later section. As seen below, we can use the built-in Path Finding queries on the Analysis tab on the Left side of the window.

https://hausec.com/2019/09/09/bloodhound-cypher-cheatsheet/

### Searching for Relationships
<img width="877" height="520" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b773ba0-6501-4dcc-a261-a7bebca3e7b8" />

The query chosen to produce the map above was Find Shortest Paths To Domain Admins. It will give us any logical paths it finds through users/groups/hosts/ACLs/GPOs, etc., relationships that will likely allow us to escalate to Domain Administrator privileges or equivalent. This will be extremely helpful when planning our next steps for lateral movement through the network. Take some time to experiment with the various features: look at the Database Info tab after uploading data, search for a node such as Domain Users and, scroll through all of the options under the Node Info tab, check out the pre-built queries under the Analysis tab, many which are powerful and can quickly find various ways to domain takeover. Finally, experiment with some custom Cypher queries by selecting some interesting ones from the Cypher cheatsheet linked above, pasting them into the Raw Query box at the bottom, and hitting enter. You can also play with the Settings menu by clicking the gear icon on the right side of the screen and adjusting how nodes and edges are displayed, enable query debug mode, and enable dark mode. Throughout the remainder of this module, we will use BloodHound in various ways, but for a dedicated study on the BloodHound tool, check out the Active Directory BloodHound module.

In the next section, we will cover running the SharpHound collector from a domain-joined Windows host and work through some examples of working with the data in the BloodHound GUI.

We experimented with several new tools for domain enumeration from a Linux host. The following section will cover several more tools we can use from a domain-joined Windows host. As a quick note, if you haven't checked out the WADComs project yet, you definitely should. It is an interactive cheat sheet for many of the tools we will cover (and more) in this module. It's hugely helpful when you can't remember exact command syntax or are trying out a tool for the first time. Worth bookmarking and even contributing to!


# Credentialed Enumeration - from Windows

In the previous section, we explored some tools we can use from our Linux attack host for enumeration with valid domain credentials. In this section, we will experiment with a few tools for enumerating from a Windows attack host, such as SharpHound/BloodHound, PowerView/SharpView, Grouper2, Snaffler, and some built-in tools useful for AD enumeration. Some of the data we gather in this phase may provide more information for reporting, not just directly lead to attack paths. Depending on the assessment type, our client may be interested in all possible findings, so even issues like the ability to run BloodHound freely or certain user account attributes may be worth including in our report as either medium-risk findings or a separate appendix section. Not every issue we uncover has to be geared towards forwarding our attacks. Some of the results may be informational in nature but useful to the customer to help improve their security posture.

At this point, we are interested in other misconfigurations and permission issues that could lead to lateral and vertical movement. We are also interested in getting a bigger picture of how the domain is set up, i.e., do any trusts exist with other domains both inside and outside the current forest? We're also interested in pillaging file shares that our user has access to, as these often contain sensitive data such as credentials that can be used to further our access.

## TTPs
The first tool we will explore is the ActiveDirectory PowerShell module. When landing on a Windows host in the domain, especially one an admin uses, there is a chance you will find valuable tools and scripts on the host.
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/?view=windowsserver2022-ps

# ActiveDirectory PowerShell Module
The ActiveDirectory PowerShell module is a group of PowerShell cmdlets for administering an Active Directory environment from the command line. It consists of 147 different cmdlets at the time of writing. We can't cover them all here, but we will look at a few that are particularly useful for enumerating AD environments. Feel free to explore other cmdlets included in the module in the lab built for this section, and see what interesting combinations and output you can create.

Before we can utilize the module, we have to make sure it is imported first. The Get-Module cmdlet, which is part of the Microsoft.PowerShell.Core module, will list all available modules, their version, and potential commands for use. This is a great way to see if anything like Git or custom administrator scripts are installed. If the module is not loaded, run Import-Module ActiveDirectory to load it for use.

Now that our modules are loaded, let's begin. First up, we'll enumerate some basic information about the domain with the Get-ADDomain cmdlet.

## Get Domain Info

```
This will print out helpful information like the domain SID, domain functional level, any child domains, and more. Next, we'll use the Get-ADUser cmdlet. We will be filtering for accounts with the ServicePrincipalName property populated. This will get us a listing of accounts that may be susceptible to a Kerberoasting attack, which we will cover in-depth after the next section.

## Get-ADUser
```
PS C:\htb> Get-ADUser -Filter {ServicePrincipalName -ne "$null"} -Properties ServicePrincipalName

```

This cmdlet will print out any trust relationships the domain has. We can determine if they are trusts within our forest or with domains in other forests, the type of trust, the direction of the trust, and the name of the domain the relationship is with. This will be useful later on when looking to take advantage of child-to-parent trust relationships and attacking across forest trusts. Next, we can gather AD group information using the Get-ADGroup cmdlet.

## Group Enumeration
```
PS C:\htb> Get-ADGroup -Filter * | select name

name
----
Administrators
Users
Guests
Print Operators
Backup Operators
Replicator
Remote Desktop Users
Network Configuration Operators
Performance Monitor Users
Performance Log Users
Distributed COM Users
IIS_IUSRS
Cryptographic Operators
Event Log Readers
Certificate Service DCOM Access
RDS Remote Access Servers
RDS Endpoint Servers
RDS Management Servers
Hyper-V Administrators
Access Control Assistance Operators
Remote Management Users
Storage Replica Administrators
Domain Computers
Domain Controllers
Schema Admins
Enterprise Admins
Cert Publishers
Domain Admins

<SNIP>
```
We can take the results and feed interesting names back into the cmdlet to get more detailed information about a particular group like so:

## Detailed Group Info
```
PS C:\htb> Get-ADGroup -Identity "Backup Operators"

DistinguishedName : CN=Backup Operators,CN=Builtin,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
GroupCategory     : Security
GroupScope        : DomainLocal
Name              : Backup Operators
ObjectClass       : group
ObjectGUID        : 6276d85d-9c39-4b7c-8449-cad37e8abc38
SamAccountName    : Backup Operators
SID               : S-1-5-32-551
```

Now that we know more about the group, let's get a member listing using the Get-ADGroupMember cmdlet.

## Group Membership
```
PS C:\htb> Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Backup Operators"

distinguishedName : CN=BACKUPAGENT,OU=Service Accounts,OU=Corp,DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL
name              : BACKUPAGENT
objectClass       : user
objectGUID        : 2ec53e98-3a64-4706-be23-1d824ff61bed
SamAccountName    : backupagent
SID               : S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-5220
```
We can see that one account, backupagent, belongs to this group. It is worth noting this down because if we can take over this service account through some attack, we could use its membership in the Backup Operators group to take over the domain. We can perform this process for the other groups to fully understand the domain membership setup. Try repeating the process with a few different groups. You will see that this process can be tedious, and we will be left with an enormous amount of data to sift through. We must know how to do this with built-in tools such as the ActiveDirectory PowerShell module, but we will see later in this section just how much tools like BloodHound can speed up this process and make our results far more accurate and organized.

Utilizing the ActiveDirectory module on a host can be a stealthier way of performing actions than dropping a tool onto a host or loading it into memory and attempting to use it. This way, our actions could potentially blend in more. Next, we will walk through the PowerView tool, which has many features to simplify enumeration and dig deeper into the domain.

## PowerView
PowerView is a tool written in PowerShell to help us gain situational awareness within an AD environment. Much like BloodHound, it provides a way to identify where users are logged in on a network, enumerate domain information such as users, computers, groups, ACLS, trusts, hunt for file shares and passwords, perform Kerberoasting, and more. It is a highly versatile tool that can provide us with great insight into the security posture of our client's domain. It requires more manual work to determine misconfigurations and relationships within the domain than BloodHound but, when used right, can help us to identify subtle misconfigurations.

Let's examine some of PowerView's capabilities and see what data it returns. The table below describes some of the most useful functions PowerView offers.

This table is not all-encompassing for what PowerView offers, but it includes many of the functions we will use repeatedly. For more on PowerView, check out the Active Directory PowerView module. Below we will experiment with a few of them.

First up is the Get-DomainUser function. This will provide us with information on all users or specific users we specify. Below we will use it to grab information about a specific user, mmorgan.

## Domain User Information
```
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -Identity mmorgan -Domain inlanefreight.local | Select-Object -Property name,samaccountname,description,memberof,whencreated,pwdlastset,lastlogontimestamp,accountexpires,admincount,userprincipalname,serviceprincipalname,useraccountcontrol

```
We saw some basic user information with PowerView. Now let's enumerate some domain group information. We can use the Get-DomainGroupMember function to retrieve group-specific information. Adding the -Recurse switch tells PowerView that if it finds any groups that are part of the target group (nested group membership) to list out the members of those groups. For example, the output below shows that the Secadmins group is part of the Domain Admins group through nested group membership. In this case, we will be able to view all of the members of that group who inherit Domain Admin rights via their group membership.
https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/Get-DomainGroupMember/

### Recursive Group Membership
```
PS C:\htb>  Get-DomainGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins" -Recurse

```

Above we performed a recursive look at the Domain Admins group to list its members. Now we know who to target for potential elevation of privileges. Like with the AD PowerShell module, we can also enumerate domain trust mappings.

### Trust Enumeration
```
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainTrustMapping

SourceName      : INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TargetName      : LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
TrustType       : WINDOWS_ACTIVE_DIRECTORY
TrustAttributes : WITHIN_FOREST
TrustDirection  : Bidirectional
WhenCreated     : 11/1/2021 6:20:22 PM
WhenChanged     : 2/26/2022 11:55:55 PM

WhenCreated     : 11/1/2021 6:20:22 PM
WhenChanged     : 2/26/2022 11:55:55 PM 
```

We can use the Test-AdminAccess function to test for local admin access on either the current machine or a remote one.

## Testing for Local Admin Access
```
PS C:\htb> Test-AdminAccess -ComputerName ACADEMY-EA-MS01

ComputerName    IsAdmin
------------    -------
ACADEMY-EA-MS01    True 
```
Above, we determined that the user we are currently using is an administrator on the host ACADEMY-EA-MS01. We can perform the same function for each host to see where we have administrative access. We will see later how well BloodHound performs this type of check. Now we can check for users with the SPN attribute set, which indicates that the account may be subjected to a Kerberoasting attack.

### Finding Users With SPN Set
```
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -SPN -Properties samaccountname,ServicePrincipalName

serviceprincipalname                          samaccountname
--------------------                          --------------

```

Test out some more of the tool's functions until you are comfortable using it. We will see PowerView quite a few more times as we progress through this module.

## SharpView
PowerView is part of the now deprecated PowerSploit offensive PowerShell toolkit. The tool has been receiving updates by BC-Security as part of their Empire 4 framework. Empire 4 is BC-Security's fork of the original Empire project and is actively maintained as of April 2022. We show examples throughout this module using the development version of PowerView because it is an excellent tool for recon in an Active Directory environment, and is still extremely powerful and helpful in modern AD networks even though the original version is not maintained. The BC-SECURITY version of PowerView has some new functions such as Get-NetGmsa, used to hunt for Group Managed Service Accounts, which is out of scope for this module. It is worth playing around with both versions to see the subtle differences between the old and currently maintained versions.

Another tool worth experimenting with is SharpView, a .NET port of PowerView. Many of the same functions supported by PowerView can be used with SharpView. We can type a method name with -Help to get an argument list.

```
PS C:\htb> .\SharpView.exe Get-DomainUser -Help

Get_DomainUser -Identity <String[]> -DistinguishedName <String[]> -SamAccountName <String[]> -Name <String[]> -MemberDistinguishedName <String[]> -MemberName <String[]> -SPN <Boolean> -AdminCount <Boolean> -AllowDelegation <Boolean> -DisallowDelegation <Boolean> -TrustedToAuth <Boolean> -PreauthNotRequired <Boolean> -KerberosPreauthNotRequired <Boolean> -NoPreauth <Boolean> -Domain <String> -LDAPFilter <String> -Filter <String> -Properties <String[]> -SearchBase <String> -ADSPath <String> -Server <String> -DomainController <String> -SearchScope <SearchScope> -ResultPageSize <Int32> -ServerTimeLimit <Nullable`1> -SecurityMasks <Nullable`1> -Tombstone <Boolean> -FindOne <Boolean> -ReturnOne <Boolean> -Credential <NetworkCredential> -Raw <Boolean> -UACFilter <UACEnum>
```
Here we can use SharpView to enumerate information about a specific user, such as the user forend, which we control.

```
PS C:\htb> .\SharpView.exe Get-DomainUser -Identity forend

## Shares
Shares allow users on a domain to quickly access information relevant to their daily roles and share content with their organization. When set up correctly, domain shares will require a user to be domain joined and required to authenticate when accessing the system. Permissions will also be in place to ensure users can only access and see what is necessary for their daily role. Overly permissive shares can potentially cause accidental disclosure of sensitive information, especially those containing medical, legal, personnel, HR, data, etc. In an attack, gaining control over a standard domain user who can access shares such as the IT/infrastructure shares could lead to the disclosure of sensitive data such as configuration files or authentication files like SSH keys or passwords stored insecurely. We want to identify any issues like these to ensure the customer is not exposing any data to users who do not need to access it for their daily jobs and that they are meeting any legal/regulatory requirements they are subject to (HIPAA, PCI, etc.). We can use PowerView to hunt for shares and then help us dig through them or use various manual commands to hunt for common strings such as files with pass in the name. This can be a tedious process, and we may miss things, especially in large environments. Now, let's take some time to explore the tool Snaffler and see how it can aid us in identifying these issues more accurately and efficiently.

## Snaffler
Snaffler is a tool that can help us acquire credentials or other sensitive data in an Active Directory environment. Snaffler works by obtaining a list of hosts within the domain and then enumerating those hosts for shares and readable directories. Once that is done, it iterates through any directories readable by our user and hunts for files that could serve to better our position within the assessment. Snaffler requires that it be run from a domain-joined host or in a domain-user context.

To execute Snaffler, we can use the command below:
https://github.com/SnaffCon/Snaffler

## Snaffler Execution
```
Snaffler.exe -s -d inlanefreight.local -o snaffler.log -v data
```
The -s tells it to print results to the console for us, the -d specifies the domain to search within, and the -o tells Snaffler to write results to a logfile. The -v option is the verbosity level. Typically data is best as it only displays results to the screen, so it's easier to begin looking through the tool runs. Snaffler can produce a considerable amount of data, so we should typically output to file and let it run and then come back to it later. It can also be helpful to provide Snaffler raw output to clients as supplemental data during a penetration test as it can help them zero in on high-value shares that should be locked down first.

## Snaffler in Action
```
PS C:\htb> .\Snaffler.exe  -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -s -v data

We may find passwords, SSH keys, configuration files, or other data that can be used to further our access. Snaffler color codes the output for us and provides us with a rundown of the file types found in the shares.

Now that we have a wealth of data about the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain (and hopefully clear notes and log file output!), we need a way to correlate it and visualize it. Let's dive deeper into BloodHound and see how powerful this tool can be during any AD-focused security assessment.

## BloodHound
As discussed in the previous section, Bloodhound is an exceptional open-source tool that can identify attack paths within an AD environment by analyzing the relationships between objects. Both penetration testers and blue teamers can benefit from learning to use BloodHound to visualize relationships in the domain. When used correctly and coupled with custom Cipher queries, BloodHound may find high-impact, but difficult to discover, flaws that have been present in the domain for years.

First, we must authenticate as a domain user from a Windows attack host positioned within the network (but not joined to the domain) or transfer the tool to a domain-joined host. There are many ways to achieve this covered in the File Transfer module. For our purposes, we will work with SharpHound.exe already on the attack host, but it's worth experimenting with transferring the tool to the attack host from Pwnbox or our own VM using methods such as a Python HTTP server, smbserver.py from Impacket, etc.

If we run SharpHound with the --help option, we can see the options available to us.

Next, we can exfiltrate the dataset to our own VM or ingest it into the BloodHound GUI tool on MS01. We can do this on MS01 by typing bloodhound into a CMD or PowerShell console. The credentials should be saved, but enter neo4j: HTB_@cademy_stdnt! if a prompt appears. Next, click on the Upload Data button on the right-hand side, select the newly generated zip file, and click Open. An Upload Progress window will pop up. Once all .json files show 100% complete, click the X at the top of that window.

We can start by typing domain: in the search bar on the top left and choosing INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL from the results. Take a moment to browse the node info tab. As we can see, this would be a rather large company with over 550 hosts to target and trusts with two other domains.

Now, let's check out a few pre-built queries in the Analysis tab. The query Find Computers with Unsupported Operating Systems is great for finding outdated and unsupported operating systems running legacy software. These systems are relatively common to find within enterprise networks (especially older environments), as they often run some product that cannot be updated or replaced as of yet. Keeping these hosts around may save money, but they also can add unnecessary vulnerabilities to the network. Older hosts may be susceptible to older remote code execution vulnerabilities like MS08-067. If we come across these older hosts during an assessment, we should be careful before attacking them (or even check with our client) as they may be fragile and running a critical application or service. We can advise our client to segment these hosts off from the rest of the network as much as possible if they cannot remove them yet, but should also recommend that they start putting together a plan to decommission and replace them.

This query shows two hosts, one running Windows 7 and one running Windows Server 2008 (both of which are not "live" in our lab). Sometimes we will see hosts that are no longer powered on but still appear as records in AD. We should always validate whether they are "live" or not before making recommendations in our reports. We may write up a high-risk finding for Legacy Operating Systems or a best practice recommendation for cleaning up old records in AD.

Unsupported Operating Systems

We will often see users with local admin rights on their host (perhaps temporarily to install a piece of software, and the rights were never removed), or they occupy a high enough role in the organization to demand these rights (whether they require them or not). Other times we'll see excessive local admin rights handed out across the organization, such as multiple groups in the IT department with local admin over groups of servers or even the entire Domain Users group with local admin over one or more hosts. This can benefit us if we take over a user account with these rights over one or more machines. We can run the query Find Computers where Domain Users are Local Admin to quickly see if there are any hosts where all users have local admin rights. If this is the case, then any account we control can typically be used to access the host(s) in question, and we may be able to retrieve credentials from memory or find other sensitive data.

## Local Admins
<img width="1292" height="786" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52ddda6c-0866-4e95-a91a-cc65d558e1ab" />
This is just a snapshot of the useful queries we can run. As we continue through this module, you will see several more that can be helpful in finding other weaknesses in the domain. For a more in-depth study on BloodHound, check out the module Active Directory Bloodhound. Take some time and try out each of the queries in the Analysis tab to become more familiar with the tool. It's also worth experimenting with custom Cypher queries by pasting them into the Raw Query box at the bottom of the screen.
