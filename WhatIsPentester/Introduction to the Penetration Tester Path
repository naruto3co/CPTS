📌 Mục đích & Triết lý học tập
    Đây là điểm bắt đầu cho ai muốn theo nghề pentester hoặc nâng cao kỹ năng.
    Bao quát toàn bộ: External Pentest, Internal Pentest (Network, Active Directory), Web App Security Assessment.
    Tập trung vào thực hành, mindset, và quy trình chuẩn thay vì chỉ chạy tool.
    Nguyên tắc: Learn by doing, chú trọng pháp lý & đạo đức (luôn cần Scope of Work, hợp đồng, ROE trước khi test).

📌 Quy trình kiểm thử thâm nhập
    Các phases chính trong Pentest:
    Pre-Engagement → chuẩn bị, phạm vi, ký kết.
    Information Gathering → thu thập thông tin (OSINT, recon, enumeration).
    Vulnerability Assessment → quét, xác định lỗ hổng.
    Exploitation → khai thác, chiếm quyền.
    Post-Exploitation → leo thang, pillaging (tìm dữ liệu, bí mật).
    Lateral Movement → di chuyển trong hệ thống.
    Project Closeout → báo cáo, PoC, khuyến nghị.
    Post-Engagement → follow-up, lessons learned.

📌 Các module quan trọng trong Path
    Recon & Enumeration: Nmap, Footprinting, Web Info Gathering, Vuln Assessment, File Transfers.
    Exploitation: Password Attacks, Common Services, Pivoting/Tunneling, AD Attacks.
    Web Exploitation: Web proxies, Ffuf, SQLi, SQLMap, XSS, File Inclusion, Upload Attacks, Command Injection.
    Post-Exploitation: Linux & Windows PrivEsc.
    Reporting: Documentation & Reporting, Attacking Enterprise Networks (capstone).

📌 Lưu ý quan trọng
    Pháp lý: Không bao giờ test ngoài phạm vi được phép, luôn có hợp đồng & scope rõ ràng.
    Đạo đức: Dùng kỹ năng đúng mục đích, tránh tham gia tổ chức giả dạng công ty pentest.
    Kỹ năng mềm: Note-taking, reporting, communication với khách hàng quan trọng không kém kỹ thuật.
    Mindset: Luôn “do no harm”, test có trách nhiệm, cẩn trọng với tool/exploit có thể gây crash.
    Practice hợp pháp: labs (HTB), bug bounty (HackerOne, Bugcrowd).




1. Pre-Engagement	The first step is to create all the necessary documents in the pre-engagement phase, discuss the assessment objectives, and clarify any questions.
2. Information Gathering	Once the pre-engagement activities are complete, we investigate the company's existing website we have been assigned to assess. We identify the technologies in use and learn how the web application functions.
3. Vulnerability Assessment	With this information, we can look for known vulnerabilities and investigate questionable features that may allow for unintended actions.
4. Exploitation	Once we have found potential vulnerabilities, we prepare our exploit code, tools, and environment and test the webserver for these potential vulnerabilities.
5. Post-Exploitation	Once we have successfully exploited the target, we jump into information gathering and examine the webserver from the inside. If we find sensitive information during this stage, we try to escalate our privileges (depending on the system and configurations).
6. Lateral Movement	If other servers and hosts in the internal network are in scope, we then try to move through the network and access other hosts and servers using the information we have gathered.
7. Proof-of-Concept	We create a proof-of-concept that proves that these vulnerabilities exist and potentially even automate the individual steps that trigger these vulnerabilities.
8. Post-Engagement	Finally, the documentation is completed and presented to our client as a formal report deliverable. Afterward, we may hold a report walkthrough meeting to clarify anything about our testing or results and provide any needed support to personnel tasked with remediating our findings.
